CSCI 4273 Programming Assignment 3 by Benjamin Brown

This program simulates a network topology of connected routers and 
uses Dykstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two routers,
generating a 'next hop' table.

Routers continuously broadcast their routing tables (adjacent routers) at
1 second intervals.  In this way the network will converge to the most 
optimal state. 

Use the makefile to compile the program. 

To run the program, the command is

./routed_LS <Router Name> <logfile> <initfile>

Where the router name is a single capital char, logfile is the path to the
logfile for this router, and initfile is the link state of the routers.

You will need to open 1 terminal per router in the initfile.

To exit cleanly (and unbind the ports) simply type 'quit' into any of 
the windows, and the routers will flood the command to each of its 
neighbors before quitting, resulting in all of the routers exiting cleanly.
