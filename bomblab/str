That's number 2.  Keep going!
Halfway there!
Good work!  On to the next...
Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
So you got that one.  Try this one.
Wow! You've defused the secret stage!
I turned the moon into something I like to call a Death Star.

So you think you can stop the bomb with ctrl-c, do you?

Curses, you've found the secret phase!
But finding it and solving it are quite different...
Congratulations! You've defused the bomb!
